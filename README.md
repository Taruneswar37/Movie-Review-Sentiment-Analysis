# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning (LSTM Neural Network). This project implements a sentiment analysis model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The dataset used is the IMDB dataset of 50K movie reviews, obtained from Kaggle.

**Features**
âœ… Deep Learning Model: Uses an LSTM-based neural network for text classification.
âœ… Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and text vectorization using Tokenizer and pad_sequences.
âœ… Training & Evaluation: Model trained on a labeled dataset with accuracy metrics.
âœ… Dataset: IMDB dataset containing 50,000 labeled movie reviews.
âœ… Implementation: Built with TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

**Results**
ðŸš€ Achieves high accuracy in sentiment classification.
ðŸš€ Handles long movie reviews effectively using LSTMâ€™s sequential memory.
